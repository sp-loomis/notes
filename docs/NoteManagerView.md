# Note Manager View Documentation

## Overview

The Note Manager View is a central component of the Notes Application that allows users to view, create, edit, and manage notes and their components. It integrates several sub-components to provide a comprehensive note management experience.

## Components Structure

The Note Manager View is composed of these key components:

1. **Note Attributes Panel** - Displays and allows editing of note details (title, creation date, tags)
2. **Component Listing Panel** - Shows all components associated with the selected note
3. **Component Viewer** (in main content area) - Displays and allows editing of component content

## Integration Architecture

These components are integrated through two primary context providers:

- **NotesContext** - Manages note state and operations
- **ComponentsContext** - Manages component state and operations

## User Workflows

### Note Selection Flow
1. User selects a note in the Note Manager View
2. NotesContext updates the selectedNote state
3. ComponentsContext loads components for the selected note
4. Note Attributes Panel displays note details
5. Component Listing Panel shows components for the note

### Component Selection Flow
1. User selects a component in the Component Listing Panel
2. ComponentsContext updates selectedComponent state
3. ComponentsContext loads the latest version of the component
4. Component Viewer displays the component content in the main area

### Component Editing Flow
1. User clicks Edit button in Component Viewer
2. Component Viewer switches to edit mode with appropriate editor
3. User modifies the content
4. User clicks Save button
5. ComponentsContext creates a new version with modified content
6. Component Viewer switches back to view mode with updated content

## Error Handling

The integrated components include comprehensive error handling:

1. **Categorized Errors** - Errors are categorized by type (LOAD, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, VERSION)
2. **Visual Feedback** - Error messages are displayed with contextual information
3. **Recovery Options** - Retry buttons allow users to attempt failed operations again
4. **Cross-Component Coordination** - Error states are managed consistently across components

## State Coordination

The following state is coordinated across components:

- Selected note state (via NotesContext)
- Note components list (via ComponentsContext)
- Selected component state (via ComponentsContext)
- Component version state (via ComponentsContext)
- Loading states (consistent display across components)
- Error states (with type-specific handling)

## Accessibility Considerations

- All interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Tab navigation flow is logical and follows UI hierarchy
- Error messages are clearly indicated with icons and contrasting colors
- All forms provide clear validation feedback

## Performance Optimizations

- Components only load data when needed
- State updates are localized to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- API calls are batched and optimized to reduce database load
- Error recovery mechanisms prevent cascading failures
